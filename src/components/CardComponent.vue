        Hi, I'm Alex, a passionate junior front-end developer with a strong ambition to grow into a
        full-fledged software engineer and game developer. I love creating dynamic and responsive
        websites that bring ideas to life through code. My journey into development started with
        front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm always eager to learn more
        and expand my skills in areas like full-stack development and game design. Explore my work,
        and let's build something amazing together!
